# concurrency-samples

These are sample code files that give a rough outline for how concurrency primatives like Locks, Semaphores, and Condition Variables are implemented under the hood. These examples are **NOT** functionally accurate and are probably not even syntactically correct JavaScript code. They are only meant to serve as a lecture aid.
